# austraits_api_v1

This is a repository containing the code to support the AusTraits API. It uses the R-plumber package to overlay a http layer over regular R fucntions and return data based on queries from a user. The goal is to ensure AusTraits data is easily accessible to more users from different backgrounds and levels of technological expertise via our partner websites. 

The basic functions allow users to subset the data based on taxa and trait, return the size of the subset given a series of confitions which include filtering by some columns containing cateogical variables. 

Developing the API functions will be an iterative process as we consult with the needs of our partners.
